Repository contains following files as part of submission for peer assignement:

	* run_analysis.R
	* README.md
	* Codebook.md

The code in run_analysis.R uses as input the files in the relative directory in the folders. In other words the following files/folders should be located relative to where run_analysis.R is:

	* har/
	* har/test
	* har/test/subject_test.txt
	* har/test/X_test.txt
	* har/test/y_test.txt
	* har/train
	* har/train/subject_train.txt
	* har/train/X_train.txt
	* har/train/y_train.txt
	* activity_labels.txt
	* features.txt
	* features_info.txt
	* README.txt
	
	The run of the R script should produce the output file which has 180 rows and 68 (66+2) columns.
